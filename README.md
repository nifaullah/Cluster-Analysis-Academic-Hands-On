# Cluster-Analysis-Academic-Hands-On
Academic Project - Learn &amp; implement different clustering techniques

Data: Multiple in-built dataset such as blobs, moons & circles.

Language: Python 3

Goal: This was a project designed by the professor to test our understanding and application of different clustering techniques learned in the class. This module included topics such as Kmeans, Expectation Maximization (Mixture Models), DB Scan, different types of Agglomerative clustering, Spectral Clustering and Cluster permonce evaluation

Approach: Professor provides us with dataset and then asks students to implement certain operations and then asks us explain the results of those operations. A sample practise module is also provided to familiarize with test.
