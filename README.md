# Cluster-Analysis-Academic-Hands-On
Academic Project - Learn &amp; implement different clustering techniques

Data: Multiple in-built dataset such as blobs, moons & circles.

Goal: This was a project designed by the professor to test our understanding and application of different clustering techniques learned in the class. This module included topics such as Kmeans, Expectation Maximization (Mixture Models), DB Scan, different types of Agglomerative clustering, Spectral Clustering and Cluster permonce evaluation

Approach: Professor provides us with dataset and then asks students to implement certain operations and then asks us explain the results of those operations. A sample practise module is also provided to familiarize with test.

Citation/Acknowledgement: This analysis was done as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course instructed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri at the University of Cincinnati. Most of the sample codes are used from the practise module.

Note: As you see there's no ipynb file provided, this is due to the project was done using the OSC's cloud (https://www.osc.edu/resources/online_portals/ondemand) and a PDF was downloaded from their to submit as final work. An attempt is being made to retrieve the file, it'd uploaded here once retrieved

Score: 10/10
